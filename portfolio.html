        </h3>
        <hr class="hrc">
        <p>Hi, I'm a software dev who loves to create cool stuff with code. I have experience in web development, mobile development and data science. I enjoy learning new technologies and solving problems. Some of the projects I'm proud of are a chatbot that helps people find the best deals online, a mobile app that tracks your fitness goals and a website that visualizes data from different sources. 
            I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.</p>

         I used to work as a junior developer for a small company that made web applications. I learned a lot about java frameworks, databases, and testing tools. I enjoyed working with my team and solving problems together. I think java is a great language for building scalable and reliable software.

         I've used C++ for various projects, such as game development, data analysis, and web scraping. I enjoy learning new features and libraries that make C++ even more expressive and modern. C++ is a language that challenges me to improve my skills and knowledge every day.
